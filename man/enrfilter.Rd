\usage{
enrfilter(
  enrichment_table,
  pval_type = "p",
  pval = 0.05,
  foldchange = 1,
  category = c("GO_BP", "GO_CC", "GO_MF", "KEGG_pathway", "REACTOME"),
  min_feature = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{enrichment_table}{should be an enrichment table generated with Protein MiniOn.}

\item{pval_type}{should be 'p' or 'padj'. By default set to 'p' and no filtering is done by pvalue.}

\item{pval}{should be a numerical value indicative of the maximum p to use for the filtering. 0.05 by default.}

\item{foldchange}{indicate a fold change filtering value for the table. 1 by default}

\item{category}{character vector indicates the categories to keep}

\item{min_feature}{numerical value that indicates the minimum of features in the query to be considered. 1 by default.}

\item{order}{should be TRUE or FALSE indicating if the order of the table should be changed.}
}
\value{
a data.frame containing enrichment results from the KEGG retrieve from UniProt.
}
\description{
Function that allows to display filter enrichment results table generated with Protein MiniOn by pvalue and fold change.
